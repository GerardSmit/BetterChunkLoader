# BetterChunkLoader
[![Build Status](http://ci.communitybuilt.net/job/BetterChunkLoader/badge/icon)](http://ci.communitybuilt.net/job/BetterChunkLoader/)

This Sponge plugin also requires the [BCLForge mod](https://github.com/KasperFranz/BCLForgeLib) which is used to save the chunks and make them loaded.


## Known issues
the database is NOT compatible with the 1.7 version of this mod, since this is making the table readable instead of being bytes - Sorry


If you have any issues with it please make an issue.

The latest builds can be found on our [CI server](http://ci.communitybuilt.net/job/BCLForgeLib/) which is provided by Community Built
